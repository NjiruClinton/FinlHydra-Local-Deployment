You can also 1-click deploy your own instance using the [Chat UI Spaces Docker template](https://huggingface.co/new-space?template=huggingchat/chat-ui-template).\\r\n\\r\nWe welcome any feedback on this app: please participate to the public discussion at <https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/discussions>\\r\n\\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingchat/chat-ui/discussions\"><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/badges/raw/main/open-a-discussion-xl.svg\" title=\"open a discussion\"></a>\\r\n`;\nconst Page = create_ssr_component(($$result, $$props, $$bindings, slots) => {\n  return `<div class=\"overflow-auto p-6\"><div class=\"prose mx-auto px-4 pb-24 pt-6 dark:prose-invert md:pt-12\"> <!-- HTML_TAG_START -->${marked(privacy, { gfm: true })}<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>`;\n});\nexport {\n  Page as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;AAEA,MAAM,OAAO,GAAG,CAAC;AACjB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,CAAC,CAAC;AACG,MAAC,IAAI,GAAG,oBAAoB,CAAC,CAAC,QAAQ,EAAE,OAAO,EAAE,UAAU,EAAE,KAAK,KAAK;AAC5E,EAAE,OAAO,CAAC,6HAA6H,EAAE,MAAM,CAAC,OAAO,EAAE,EAAE,GAAG,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC,iCAAiC,CAAC,CAAC;AAC3M,CAAC;;;;"}
